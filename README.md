## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Your Weather API Key

To use this app, you need a Weather API key.  

1. Open the file:

```text
lib/services/weather_service.dart
```

```dart
final String apiKey = "-------YOUR_API_KEY------";
```

3. Replace the value with your own API key. For example:

```

You can get a free API key from a weather API provider such as [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
